## proxmox-init

proxmox-init is a (very) simple ansible playbook that automates the task of
creating a KVM template on the Proxmox VE platform.

proxmox-init is intended to act as a base and shouldn't be used in production as
is. Instead, it should be configured to work for your specific use case.
